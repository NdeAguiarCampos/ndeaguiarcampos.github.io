        summary: Challenged a widespread assumption from water budget models that same-size trees have similar transpiration rates, which is estimated via sap flow. We found up to 10-fold variation in sap flow across trees and on average 34% variation within trees in a cohort of similar trees.

        summary: In this systematic review, we showed that sap-flow-based transpiration research in tropical forests has significant gaps and biases. It provides clear guidelines and recommendations to improve the tropical data gap in sap flow compilation initiatives such as SAPFLUXNET.
