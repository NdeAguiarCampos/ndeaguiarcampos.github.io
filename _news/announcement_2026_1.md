In this study, entitled ["Crown exposure drives sap flow variability among nearly identical trees in a lowland tropical rainforest"](https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.177012032.27017055/v1) we challenged the long-held assumption in transpiration upscaling studies that cohorts of similar trees have similar transpiration rates. It is currently under review in [_Hydrological Processes_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10991085) 🤞🏾

Tropical rainforests are known for their high species diversity, complex canopies and vital contributions to the regional and global water cycles. Unsurprisingly, estimating this contribution presents significant challenges - some of which begin in the field. 

Forest-level transpiration can be estimated _in situ_ quantifying **sap flow in a set of trees** considered to be representative of the site's main functional groups and diameter distribution. This is based on the assumption that similar trees will have similar water requirements - **but is it true?** 

Very briefly, sap flow can be measured by inserting heater and thermistor needles in the water-conducting part of a tree's trunk and tracking temperature changes above and below the heater needle. Depending on the side of the turnk where you insert these needles, it is believed you may get slightly different results - **but how different?**

In our study, we selected a group of nearly identical trees and monitored their sap flow variation over time in a 1-ha plot in the Daintree rainforest, in northeastern Australia. All trees were from the species _Myristica globosa_ subsp. _muelleri_ (also known as the Queensland nutmeg) and had on average ~31 cm in diameter and ~21 m in height. But here's the catch: despite having very similar heights, the trees were in different positions in the canopy relative to neighbouring trees, with different degrees of crown exposure.

What we found was striking: Sap flow collected in two different trees at the same time could have a difference of up to **10-fold**! On average, the difference between trees had coefficients of variation between 45% and 70% depending on season. We also found that on average simultaneous sap flow readings within the same trees have a **34% difference** depending on where you decide to place the sap flow sensors. Most of the variation between and within trees was explained by **crown exposure**! 

OVerall, our results mean that, even if trees have nearly identical appearances, their position in the canopy may have a much greater influence on their physiological functioning than size alone. To prevent error from propagating from the field to larger-scale models, we recommend that (1) at least two sap flow readings should be taken from individual trees to capture their intrinsic variation, and (2) crown exposure should be used as a criterion to define tree groups for transpiration estimation - after all, it greatly explained variability within and among trees in this tropical rainforest.
