In this systematic review, entitled ["Tropical forest transpiration estimates are geographically, ecologically and methodologically biased: a systematic review of sap flow research"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110738), I identified key knowledge gaps in tropical forest sap flow research and suggested paths to tackle them.

That tropical forests are some of the most important water pumps from land to atmosphere is a well-known fact. The normal functioning of these ecosystems results in an immense flux of water vapour ([estimated as one-third of global evapotranspiration](https://doi.org/10.1016/J.AGRFORMET.2014.01.011)) that feeds Earth's hydrological cycle. One of the main ways that hydrologists parameterise global models is by measuring **sap flow** in individual trees in the field and, then, upscaling to stand-level transpiration. 

While there's been great effort to compile sap flow data globally in the awesome [SAPFLUXNET](https://sapfluxnet.creaf.cat/) initiative, there's still a large data gap in the tropics. To detect geographical, ecological and methodological patterns in our current state of knowledge in tropical forest sap flow research, I did a (not gonna lie, quite tedious even though rewarding!) **systematic review** of the literature.

After reading thousands of abstracts and hundreds of papers, I selected 72 studies conducted in 85 tropical forest sites and came to some alarming conclusions:

<ul>
    <li>Only 6% of studies were conducted in the African continent, despite their outstanding contribution to biodiversity and climate resilience</li>
    <li>Dry forests are severely understudied, with only 25% of the studies (against 75% in wetter forests)</li>
    <li>Despite their increasing importance in forest ecology, liana sap flow is rarely measured (< 6% of studies)</li>
    <li>Sap flow methods are often poorly reported and lack standardisation</li>
</ul>

By pointing to these gaps, I hoped to launch my contribution to the field of **Ecohydrology** and lay out the bases for many more (empirical) studies to come!
