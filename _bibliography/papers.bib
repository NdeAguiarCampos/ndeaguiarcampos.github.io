  abstract={Tropical forest transpiration is essential for the maintenance of the water and carbon cycles and regulation of the global climate. However, recent collective efforts to compile sap flow data, which is the most widely used method for quantifying transpiration in woody stems, have revealed a large data gap in the tropics. Furthermore, accurately upscaling point measurements of sap flow to whole-plant water use (PWU) requires data inputs and corrections that may be difficult to determine in highly diverse tropical forests. This systematic review has two main goals: to assess the methodological limitations of PWU research in tropical forests and to highlight geographical and ecological gaps among current tropical forest PWU research. Our Web of Science search used terms related to ‘plant water use’ and ‘tropical forest’ and gathered all peer-reviewed studies that used sap flow sensors and upscaled point measurements to PWU in tropical forests. Based on 72 studies conducted in 85 locations, we found that drier forest types (based on Holdridge life zones) are largely underrepresented in the literature, with more than 75% of the research output concentrated in wetter forest types. We also identified a substantial knowledge gap on liana sap flow, which appeared in less than 6% of the studies. Regarding the methodological limitations, most studies omitted information regarding the number of sensors deployed per plant and the method of zero-flow determination. Other shortcomings specific to each sap flow sensor type are highlighted. Our study underscores the need for standardising key methodological aspects and identifies significant geographical and ecological gaps in tropical forest PWU research. It provides a foundation for further studies to refine estimates of the present and future contributions of tropical forest transpiration to the global water cycle.}

  abstract={Carbon stock and uptake are among the main ecosystem services provided by tropical forests. Understanding the role of different drivers in current patterns of carbon stock and uptake is critical to predicting tropical forest responses to environmental changes. That said, taxonomic identity and evolutionary relatedness among taxa may synthesize intrinsic functional characteristics and provide insight into these patterns. Here we investigated the main ecological drivers (taxonomic vs. environmental effects) and the evolutionary legacy on the expression of two important variables: carbon stock and carbon uptake. The dataset used are composed by tropical forests sites located in the southeast of Brazil along a climatic gradient including evergreen forests, semideciduous forests and deciduous forests. Relying on forest inventory data from 30 tropical forest sites (33.86 ha), we calculated individual tree carbon stocks and obtained two variables at the population level (species per site): average carbon stock (ton/ha) and average carbon uptake (ton/ha/year). These variables were used joint to phylogenetic trees and analysis to evaluate the main factors explained the variables variation and the evolutionary fingerprint on them. Variations in carbon stock and uptake by individual trees were mostly determined by taxonomic identity (28.7% and 26.7%, respectively) rather than environmental factors (7.1% and 8.9%, respectively), but evolutionary relatedness did not predict similarity among species. Our results indicate that the ability of species to store and absorb carbon depend on their intrinsic characteristics, although these are not shared among closely related taxa. Climate projections predict the loss of species unable to adapt to novel conditions, which, in light of our results, could impact tropical carbon dynamics. Although evolutionary relatedness does not predict similarity in terms of function at the scale of our study (suggesting lability of traits related to carbon storage), species losses indicate that environmental changes are beyond species’ ability to adapt to changes.}

  abstract={Resprouting is a plant persistence strategy in response to disturbance or stressful environmental conditions. Resprouters can dominate in stressful environments such as tropical dry forests (TDFs), but our knowledge of resprouting in TDFs is limited. Here, using a dataset of forest inventories in 16 TDF fragments (covering 15,642 trees and 321 species), we investigated patterns of resprouting in ecosystems subject to substantial seasonal water stress. We focused on two resprouting metrics: the proportion of trees that are multistemmed (resprouting frequency) and the number of stems per tree. In addition, we investigated the relative importance of environmental factors, taxonomic identity, and evolutionary history in resprouting response. Taxa with low to medium resprouting frequencies (17.19%–40.2%) are the most prevalent in TDF, compared to non-resprouters and high-frequency resprouters. Overall, resprouting ability appears to be an intrinsic trait that varies in response to environmental conditions but only within a range constrained by taxonomic identity. However, we found no phylogenetic signal above the genus level for any resprouting variables. Thus, the variation in resprouting across TDF lineages likely has been shaped by divergence between closely related taxa and convergence between distantly related ones, reflecting the specific environmental and disturbance factors to which they have been subjected.}

  abstract={The tropical forest carbon sink is known to be drought sensitive, but it is unclear which forests are the most vulnerable to extreme events. Forests with hotter and drier baseline conditions may be protected by prior adaptation, or more vulnerable because they operate closer to physiological limits. Here we report that forests in drier South American climates experienced the greatest impacts of the 2015–2016 El Niño, indicating greater vulnerability to extreme temperatures and drought. The long-term, ground-measured tree-by-tree responses of 123 forest plots across tropical South America show that the biomass carbon sink ceased during the event with carbon balance becoming indistinguishable from zero (−0.02 ± 0.37 Mg C ha−1 per year). However, intact tropical South American forests overall were no more sensitive to the extreme 2015–2016 El Niño than to previous less intense events, remaining a key defence against climate change as long as they are protected.}

  abstract={Granite-gneiss rock outcrop inselbergs are ancient stable ecosystems with old, climatically-buffered infertile landscapes (OCBILs). Although inselbergs provide key ecosystem services, little is done for their conservation and, so far, a lot of their unknown evolutionary history has already been lost by human activities. Using a fine-scale approach, here we tested if habitat and environmental filtering (the inselberg’s harshness) affect the evolutionary diversity of an Atlantic Forest inselberg in Brazil. We recorded all trees with a diameter at breast height ≥ 5 cm in 20 plots in four habitat types (total sampled area of 0.8 hectares), from highest to lowest: island, hillside, foothill, and semideciduous forest (matrix). We also collected soil samples for chemical, textural and physical soil characterization. We fitted linear models to test the effects of soil and habitat on plot-level metrics of phylogenetic diversity and structure, lineage diversity, phylogenetic β-diversity, and evolutionary distinctiveness. We found that the upper inselberg habitats contain a distinct set of ancient, closely related, harsh-tolerant lineages, as well as a subset of lineages that persist under harsh conditions with a certain degree of water availability. The inferior inselberg habitats harbor higher lineage diversity than expected by chance. Soil strongly predicted evolutionary diversity. We concluded that soil depth, slope, nutrients and texture (environmental filtering) and habitat types and topography (habitat filtering) shape the evolutionary history contained in fine-scale inselberg habitats, which should encourage the conservation of these ancient ecosystems.}

  abstract={We aimed at disentangling the effects of spatial distance, current and past environmental dissimilarity, and their combinations on tree community taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover by addressing the following questions: (i) Is tree community taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover related to the indirect effects of spatial distance via environmental dissimilarity? (ii) Does tree community taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover respond to paleoclimate (Last Glacial Maximum and Mid-Holocene)? The study was carried out in 14 Atlantic rainforest sites in Brazil (20.4 ha sampled) containing 615 tree species from 83 plant families. We obtained plot-level geographic coordinates and soil variables and site-level bioclimatic variables in the current, Mid-Holocene and Last Glacial Maximum. We used structural equation models with a distance-based approach to (i) test the direct effects of spatial distance and environmental dissimilarity and (ii) test the indirect effects of spatial distance via environmental dissimilarity on taxonomic (Bray–Curtis distance) and phylogenetic turnover (Comdist and Comdistnt distances). Our results suggest a weak indirect effect of spatial distance via environmental dissimilarity on taxonomic and phylogenetic turnover. Tree community turnover was driven by the direct effects of neutral, niche-based and historical processes. Thus, we inferred that the paleoclimate (historical processes) promoted the selection of the clades that gave rise to the current flora, while spatial distances (neutral processes) limited the dispersal range of species from the regional pool and environmental conditions (niche-based processes) locally selected the taxa that are able to persist.}

  abstract={Forest dynamics are driven by a myriad of factors and link directly to ecosystem services. The dynamics of the highly degraded Brazilian Atlantic Forest (AF) hotspot is mostly driven by its anthropogenic context. Currently, most of the AF region is composed of small disturbed secondary forest fragments that have received partial or full environmental protection with recent environmental norms. Such protection prevents further disturbances and consequently shifts the course of forest dynamics and ecosystem services in AF. Here, we assess long-term forest dynamics trends of a small secondary AF fragment to test the hypothesis that disturbed AF fragments are reaching advanced successional stages. We used a unique dataset of 126 permanent subplots (totaling 5.04 ha) monitored for 30 years (8 inventories between 1987 and 2017) of a disturbed secondary AF fragment (6.35 ha) that has been fully protected since 1986. In each inventory, we measured all living trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 5 cm and counted survivors, recruits and dead individuals between intervals. We monitored the temporal trends of (i) structural variables (biomass, tree density and species richness), (ii) functional composition (wood density and maximum potential size), (iii) and species dominance. Our results indicate that, now under full protection, the fragment is shifting towards a late successional stage: we observed increasing biomass, decreasing tree density (self-thinning) and increasing abundance of late-successional species with conservative strategies. Species richness and dominant species composition were stable throughout the monitoring period, suggesting an absence of substantial changes in community assembly. These results underscore the role played by small secondary AF fragments in ecosystem service provision (e.g., carbon uptake and shelter for biodiversity) and point to their forest dynamics trends.}

  abstract={
    The extent (or lack) of phylogenetic signal for key ecological traits reveals the role of evolutionary processes on present-day ecosystem function and hints on future ecological trends under climate change scenarios. This approach has been applied to South American tropical moist forests, but not to the highly threatened seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF), despite the acknowledgement of their unique evolutionary history. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the legacy of evolutionary processes on vital ecological characteristics among SDTF trees: regional dominance, tree size and soil preference.
    We used tree community data on 313 plots of SDTF (12.52 ha) and locally collected soil data in central-eastern Brazil. For each assessed trait (three for regional dominance, three for tree size and nine for soil preference), we investigated the legacy of evolution using two different approaches: calculating the extent of phylogenetic signal and comparing the fit of four different models of evolution.
    Above-ground woody biomass and tree size showed strong phylogenetic signal. Most of the SDTF biomass stock was concentrated on a few large-sized and closely related tree genera. Among the soil preference variables, only phosphorus displayed significant, albeit weak, phylogenetic signal.
    Synthesis. Our study is the first to show that evolutionary constraints related to tree size significantly determine regional biomass stocks of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) in a few closely related tree lineages. This suggests that even isolated SDTF fragments with low taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity can play an important role in the global carbon cycle, storing disproportionally large amounts of carbon in trees that belong to high-biomass lineages. Whether these lineages also share climate change-induced mortality risk deserves future investigation, as they are largely responsible for the maintenance of regional SDTF biomass stocks.}

  abstract={Forest community dynamics is a topic of great interest in times when the global carbon budget is a widespread concern due to climate change. Among its effects, longer periods of drought and liana proliferation, coupled with land use change, may endanger tropical forest carbon sinks. Here, in a 10.3 ha sampling of six Atlantic semideciduous forests, we investigated the effects of liana crown occupancy and large-stemmed lianas, as well as their interactions with climate and soil, on forest dynamics. We expected that harsh environmental conditions would enhance the negative effects of lianas on forest productivity. Our hypothesis was corroborated by the findings that the positive effect of lianas on tree mortality increases under drier conditions, as well as their negative effect on tree recruitment. In addition, liana crown occupancy was the best predictor of net aboveground woody biomass productivity, which decreases as liana crown occupancy increases. Our study provides additional evidence of indirect climate change impacts on the tropical forest carbon sink by increasing the negative effects of liana crown occupancy on tree biomass productivity.}

Here, we used data from 32 tropical seasonal forest sites, monitored from 1987 to 2020 (mean site monitoring length, ~15 years) to investigate their long-term trends in carbon stocks and sinks. Our results highlight a long-term decline in the net carbon sink (0.13 Mg C ha−1 year−1) caused by decreasing carbon gains (2.6% by year) and increasing carbon losses (3.4% by year). The driest and warmest sites are experiencing the most severe carbon sink decline and have already moved from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Because of the importance of the terrestrial carbon sink for the global climate, policies are needed to mitigate the emission of greenhouse gases and to restore and protect tropical seasonal forests.}

In the context of lacking knowledge on fine-scale vegetation and environmental heterogeneity of these geoecosystems and having a limestone outcrop in eastern Brazil as a case study, we address the question: how important are limestone outcrops for SDTF tree community composition, structure, function and evolution? We distinguished five habitats related to position and distance to the outcrop, and within each of 25 sampled plots (five per habitat), we identified and measured the diameter of all living tree individuals and collected soil samples for chemical and textural analyses. We investigated taxonomic and phylogenetic substitution across the habitats and fitted linear models to test the effects of habitat type, soil fertility and texture on taxonomic/structural, functional and phylogenetic parameters. We found striking taxonomic and phylogenetic differentiation among the habitats, especially related to recent diversification, with soil fertility and texture largely accounting for variations in all analysed parameters. Given the predominant roles of vicariance and in situ diversification believed to have given rise to the current patterns of endemism and diversity of eastern Brazil SDTF, we argue that the conditions presented by limestone outcrops, including aridity and high fertility, may have favoured the persistence of SDTF lineages during the Quaternary environmental changes, highlighting their role as litho-refugia. In order to complete this biogeographic puzzle, we encourage other fine-scale assessments of outcrop-associated SDTF from the phylogenetic viewpoint.}

  abstract={The resilience or sensitivity of seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF) to climate change remains an important issue because of their biodiversity and ecosystem services provision. Understand the underlying ecological processes of SDTF is crucial for the development of conservation and management strategies. We tested the hypotheses that SDTF tree species richness, above-ground woody biomass (AGWB), species and phylogenetic compositions are related to climate, soil and their interactions. We sampled 16 old-growth forest sites (313 plots) of SDTF within a 290 km latitudinal gradient. The sites are located in the transition zone between Caatinga and Cerrado biogeographic domains, and are near from Atlantic domain (~100 km). In each site we collected data on vegetation (trees with diameter at breast height ≥3 cm) and soil, and obtained climate data from WorldClim. Almost all vegetation attributes were significantly related to climate and soil. Soil texture mediated the effects of precipitation for tree species richness, AGWB and phylogenetic composition. Tree species richness decreases with annual precipitation but increases under less seasonal conditions; water availability leads to increases in AGWB and drives changes in both taxonomic and phylogenetic composition in these environments. Our findings indicate that tree species richness, above-ground woody biomass, taxonomic and phylogenetic composition of SDTFs are, in general, vulnerable to drought events even from local to regional scales and show the importance of local-scale aspects to understand SDTF diversity and ecosystem functioning; and provide useful information for conservation and management strategies.}

Previous research has shown that niche plasticity may increase diversity in plant communities, and that plasticity may be linked to variations in species fitness. Spatial and temporal aspects of the niche are of interest to understand community structure, but the temporal dimension is often difficult to incorporate in ecological research. In this study, we investigated if species–habitat associations are stable across time, and if they are not, whether niche plasticity promotes variations in species fitness and increases in diversity. We modeled the representativity of 36 species as a function of soil variables and slope in an Atlantic tropical wet forest located in southeast Brazil, as well as their interactions with time, monitored over a period of 17 years. We found niche plasticity to be a common mechanism among the studied species in the studied time period. Niche plasticity was neither significantly related to variations in species fitness nor to changes in species richness, but had a negative effect on diversity when species abundance was accounted for (Shannon and Simpson indexes). We were able to make relevant observations of species–environment relationships over time, such as their niche stability and its effects on the community. We argue that this knowledge is useful in a context of climate change for revealing mechanisms used by plants to cope with environmental oscillations.}
