I am currently pursuing a PhD in Tropical Forest Ecology at James Cook University investigating the functional traits of tropical rainforest trees under experimental drought. My research focusses on tree hydraulic traits and water use, encompassing biological interactions and drought-coping strategies in non-drought-adapted rainforest tree species. My research background was primarily in my home country, Brazil, where I delved into the legacy of evolution on the community structure and ecosystem services provided by largely neglected tropical dry forests.
