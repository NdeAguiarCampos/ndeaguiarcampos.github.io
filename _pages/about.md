Welcome to my brand-new website! Here you’ll (eventually) find more details about my work on ecohydrology, ecophysiology, tropical forests, evolutionary ecology, biogeography and climate change.

I'm a **final-year PhD candidate** in Natural and Physical Sciences at James Cook University, in Australia. My current research in the beautiful [Daintree Rainforest](https://www.jcu.edu.au/daintree) investigates how functionally distinct tree species respond to prolonged drought, focussing on their hydraulic traits and water use. An important part of this work has been to identify significant [methodological shortcomings](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110738) in field-based tree water use research and ways to [mitigate uncertainty](https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.177012032.27017055/v1) in transpiration estimations.

I conducted my previous research primarily in my home country, Brazil, where I delved into the [legacy of evolution](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13589) on the community structure and ecosystem services provided by [largely neglected tropical dry forests](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10531-019-01923-4).
